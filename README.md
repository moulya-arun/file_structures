                                                      ABSTRACT 

In this mini project I have created an application which is easy to access and user friendly. The project title is “Indexing based on Primary & Secondary key”, which is used in the application and for distinguishing the type of file structure to be used. As we all know Index is a table containing a list of topics(keys) & numbers of pages where the topics can be found(reference fields). In this mini project I have implemented indexing technique based on primary and secondary key. This particular code was created using the programming language JAVA with an objective to formulate user-friendly access to build indexes based on the selected keys. Indexing simplify the work and it takes the same time to search the first as well as the last record in the file. Thus, this code is more efficient and broader as it can build indexes based both on primary and secondary keys.
